0.4.6 ()
=====
* Minor fixes around GC when using the stream API.
* Fix filename encoding in openfile on windows platforms.

0.4.5 (03-08-2015)
=====
* Dummy github release.

0.4.4 (04-10-2011)
=====
* Report more info about frames: private, copyright and original bits.
* New decode_msg example that uses the above feature.

0.4.3 (24-08-2011)
=====
* Added more general frame format reporting,
  including mpeg layer, channel mode and emphasis
  information.

0.4.2 (02-07-2011)
=====
* Changed implementation to
  make it possible to process an mp3
  frame without decoding it. This helps
  for seeking in mp3 files and computing
  duration.
  Functions added: 
    - [get_current_time]
    - [skip_frame]

0.4.1 (12-05-2011)
=====
* Added [skip_id3tags] to skip id3 tags
  on mad streams (e.g. handlers opened with
  [openstream]).

0.4.0 (19-08-2010)
=====
* Changed decode_frame to return
  only mono data when there is only one channel.
* Removed confusing wav_* and samplefreq API
* Fixed duration to use decode_float
* Fixed compilation using MinGW for win32
* Forced opening files in binary mode.

0.3.6 (12-10-2009)
=====
* Added support for --enable-debugging configure option
* Fixed mad compilation variables
  when compiling without pkg-config.
* Added prefix to main compilation variables
  if passed to configure.
* Makefile now honnors LIBDIRS
  variable for linking against libraries
  located in other places than then standard
  ones.
* Added NO_CUSTOM to build
  in standard mode.

0.3.5 (05-01-2009)
=====
* Skip ID3 tags when decoding mp3 files.
  Fixes #162

0.3.4 (27-05-2008)
=====
* Close file descriptor after duration computation
  Fixes #141

0.3.3 (16-04-2008)
=====
* More portable make invokation
* Install .cmx file
* Fixed crash in decoding routine due to recursive stack 
  overflow

0.3.2 (17-10-2007)
=====
* Improved configure support

0.3.1 (22-05-2007)
=====
* Added decode_frame_float to decode directly to float arrays.
* Added get_output_format to get the format of outputed PCM.

0.3.0 (02-03-2007)
=====
* Minor memory fixes
* Changed interface for getting the real output sample frequency

0.2.1 (11-11-2006)
=====
* Minor bugfix in decoding error's handling, got rid of audio glitches.
* More portable configure/build system.

0.2.0 (07-07-2006)
=====
* Added openstream function.
* Using caml_alloc_custom to create madfile values.
* Corrected a GC issue in ocaml_mad_decode_frame.
* Decoding (decode_frame) now releases the main OCaml mutex to let other threads
  run while decoding.

0.1.3 (20-04-2005)
=====
* Updated OCamlMakefile and improved the build system.
* Using caml namespace.
* Makefile and configure cleaning.
* Avoided memory leak on failure in ocaml_openfile.

0.1.2 (30-06-2004)
=====
* Removed openfd, since it isn't used and fdopen(2) is not ANSI C.
* Improved the mli documentation.

0.1.1 (11-02-2004)
